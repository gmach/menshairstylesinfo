    "description": "Think of this as an ultra-short tapered cut. Hair for men who subscribe\n      to the fade, tends to be short on top and gradually shorter\n      down the sides and back of the head. By the time the eye reaches\n      the nape of the neck, it looks as though the hair has faded away\n      into the wearer's skin."
