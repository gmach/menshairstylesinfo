Think of this as an ultra-short tapered cut. Hair for men who subscribe
      to the fade, tends to be short on top and gradually shorter
      down the sides and back of the head. By the time the eye reaches
      the nape of the neck, it looks as though the hair has faded away
      into the wearer's skin.
