    "description": "This is a sort of modern answer to the pompadour.\n      Keep the hair fairly short on the sides and longer\n      on the top, and that's because this look is all about\n      volume. Achieved through the use of styling cream,\n      hair spray, and a little heat from a hair dryer, the quiff\n      takes the hair upward and slightly forward."
