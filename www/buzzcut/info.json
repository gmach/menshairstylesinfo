    "description": "This term can refer to almost any cut a barber achieves
    with
    a
    pair
    of
    clippers
    that
    renders
    the
    side
    of
    your
    head
    nearly
    bare
    but
    guys
    like
    Pharrell
    Williams
    get
    nearly
    bald
    all
    over.
