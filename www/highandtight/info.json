    "description": "Military personnel favor the high and tight for its clean\n      simplicity - and for the patch of hair it leaves on the top\n      of the head, which was originally left intact to help support\n      the weight of a helmet. This buzz-cut variant is more\n      restrictive than its cousin the crew cut because it doesn't\n      taper from crown to neck."
