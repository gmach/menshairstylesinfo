Military personnel favor the high and tight for its clean
      simplicity - and for the patch of hair it leaves on the top
      of the head, which was originally left intact to help support
      the weight of a helmet. This buzz-cut variant is more
      restrictive than its cousin the crew cut because it doesn't
      taper from crown to neck.
