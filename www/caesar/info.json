    "description": "There's a reason so many guys, famous and otherwise, wore\n    the Caesar cut in the nineties. The look gave men as diverse\n    as George Clooney and Eminem a direct line to Julius Caesar\n    himself, who's crowning achievement might just be a cut that\n    was short all over with a noticeable bit of fringe at the top\n    of the forehead."
