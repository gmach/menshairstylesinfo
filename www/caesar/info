There's a reason so many guys, famous and otherwise, wore
    the Caesar cut in the nineties. The look gave men as diverse
    as George Clooney and Eminem a direct line to Julius Caesar
    himself, who's crowning achievement might just be a cut that
    was short all over with a noticeable bit of fringe at the top
    of the forehead.
